Value of air gestures,Coarse interactions,8,"[move toolbar] if like like I wanted that little tiny thing on the screen as opposed to like the large window like I, I don't know if intuitive for or yeah, like intuitively for me like I I like, my mental model is. [...] Like if it's something big like I get like gestures, make a lot of sense to me, but if it's something really small on screen like I don't know like like I I would think like oh like well, I'd actually like how much work will it take for me to actually have it recognize that like I want that thing as opposed to something else on the screen?","[grab and release photo] I I don't know if this is like how this was designed, but the way I think about it is like let's say I wanted to grab that particular image. How do I know that like I'm grabbing that image instead of like? Let's say that image is in a browser, I'm not taking that entire browser and moving it over. I would probably like physically click on the image on the phone. Actually make contact like touch the image and then probably grab it like grab it.",,"[move app] So when do you move the mouse between screens? It's because of the change of screen resolution because of the the slight imperfection, the different in sizes, the slight imperfections within the location. It creates a discontinuity, right? If you're just using a gesture, and if if of course if the image that transition is smooth enough. [...] Its way cooler I. I don't know cooler is is not a great word but I think it would be. I would prefer to do that.","[gesture shortcuts] So in kind of the in the in the use case you have, it's very ideal. There's three things, it's really fast. You could just do that. But if you were like a sloppy computer as I am [with more app opened to choose from], I can imagine it potentially being slower.","[move toolbar] I think I think that works right. I think that works, it's it. Just probably may need to be precise enough, right? So there may be, you know, some lag time, right? For people to like really get that correct so that the sensor can actually sense the hand movements. Like if it's a bigger screen you know then it's easier, right? But if it's a smaller, if you're working on a 15 inch screen that most of us are right now, like you know, it could be that you'll need to be very specific so there could be a little bit of a time like right in achieving or accomplishing that activity.",,"[gesture modifier] I just think it's  [pairing gesture with additional modality] like more control, especially like if you're using a component of an uh of a larger application. Yeah, I think that like the role of like having like, the key is definitely like. Just like applying like more like control and precision. I think like having a like being able to call out like you know, like mute, like if I'm for instance like grabbing grabbing something like part of an application run, grabbing part of application and I want to say like move to tablet one you know then like that would be then I could just be like.","[move app] UM, is that you know how, when you're going to like, select something or you're like hovering your mouse. There's a lot of different elements, right? It's like you're either selecting text or you're clicking on a link, or you're grabbing the window so there's a lot of different elements that you could possibly grab, and so it makes me a little bit anxious to say, well, how do I know I'm grabbing the right element? What do I do if I want to just grab some text or an image from inside of the window to move over?","[split app] [The gesture] does make sense, but I just think I'm like I think if I'm used to grabbing things like this and then all of a sudden like oh I'm trying to manipulate a smaller like it's it's. It's essentially like, oh you're making me put multiple different gestures together in in one right? So I it's like I don't know what that would be. It would almost be like I would kind of like a voice and gesture like.",
Value of air gestures,Coarse interactions,,"[input redirection] Uh, because like the menu kind of involves, like pointing at a distinct object, but if there's some way to say like this plus something, because like I, I don't. I don't know if I necessarily need the precision of saying like I need that thing, or at least like if if it's constrained to like one or two options, then then I can get away with like a low precision gesture as opposed to something that requires me to use a little bit more dexterity to say like that as opposed to like I'm I'm I'm signaling to move something and.",,,,"[gesture shortcuts] Uh, yeah. But just if you're copy pasting lots of things, it's very ungraceful in any platform, [similar to] touch on the phone.",,,,,,

Value of air gestures,Coarse interactions,,,,,,"Uh, I I said yes you can pick it up and pick up the toolbar and but actually doing that is kind of hard because you click on the wrong window really off if you're just trying to get the window Chrome, I will often try and grab the window Chrome to do something and I've hit the wrong one and so now something else is in the forefront.",,,,,,
Value of air gestures,Efficiency,6,"[audio redirection] The current UX implementation is is hum is time consuming. Uhm and and there's also what I call a kind of like a high precision, high dexterity thing. Where like I have to. [...] Two pairs of headphones so this or like more of like a wireless headset. I have to go through the UX and kind of like click on a few things and kind of make it work and kind of hope that it actually does what I wanted to do.","[audio redirection] And then like move it from one thing to another that is way faster for me to do than trying to click around a bunch. And I think the other reason I was talking about like why all those other gestures or things I didn't like as much is because I was like, well, I know how to do that quickly on the keyboard anyway, so I don't have to take my hands away from the keyboard, but if I have to figure this out for like 10 minutes, which sometimes I've had to do where I'm like, why are my speakers working? Why isn't this paired blah blah blah words this thing in the UI? Then I have to search. It's just way easier to do this.",,,"[gesture shortcuts] So in kind of the in the in the use case you have, it's very ideal. There's three things, it's really fast. You could just do that.

We need this easier way to get things from your phone on a computer cause I do that all the time.,,"[extend desktop] And it makes some very common tasks really simple, and I like the idea of having my being able to expand my environment in my ecosystem, like that it just feels very intuitive and when I see it, I feel like it should be. It should be existing already.",,
Value of air gestures,Efficiency,,,,,,"[gesture shortcuts] In the general sense, I always have like 60 things open on my computer, so I can imagine doing either Alt tab or the key or the gesture and having like a big window. And I think if you're doing the keyboard shortcut, it's actually really fast to just go do do do, do do do. It's like OK, I've got a bunch of things and the one I want is 8 over so I can hit the key 8 times really fast. But if I have a screen and I have to look at it and then like ho oh there it isn't hover. I can see that actually being quite a bit slower.",,[audio redirection] I don’t have multiple source of audio. So it is less applicable to me. I have just the speakers going on all the time. It is probably useful to other people because I see them always struggling with audio all the time on meetings. ,,,,

Value of air gestures,Usability*,6,,,,"[move app] Uh, another particular case is if I am not using my mouse but my touchpad. Dragging windows says it is not that super comfortable, so being able to use the gesture would be would be great, and I often use the touch pad. [...] There is this thing on Windows that if you lift your finger you just you lose the the graph on the object while on the mac you have like one second or something and they just still keep it? Which which I love because it's easier to do longer movements. [...] so yeah with this gesture you wouldn't need to worry about that because it's great.","[extend desktop] Sometimes I've got a URL [that I want to open on my computer] and it is hard to zoom the URL open on my phone to type it on my computer. if I could just like swipe it onto my computer, that would be great. That would save a lot of embarrassment and like awkward shifting things.","[audio redirection] Keyboard free experience? Yes, this would be a 6.5 for me. I loved it. I mean yeah I would do that too.","[extend desktop] I already use my phone with my computer and if I huh did not have to have windows and other apps on my computer, I would prefer use my phone and also, if I could use my mouse or my keyboard with my phone then that would make writing messages faster or take notes. keep up with things. [...] I like having a lot of things [device] available to me.","[extend desktop] I wouldn't need to then buy a second monitor, so I think like yeah, [...] if it was multiple computers and not maybe a desktop to phone situation.","[grab and release photo] Ah yeah, I would give that a 7 as well because right now that experience is so clunky and like do I text it to myself? Do I email it to myself?",,
Value of air gestures,Usability*,,,,,,"[phone navigation] Figma has it and mural has it but you have to like click a button and I always forget to click the button and then click back out of it. So if I actually especially if it was an especially if having it on my phone allowed me to not put myself in that state where now I can't edit like if I could still edit and re moving around that would actually be really [...] Yeah, and I do a lot of things where there's a lot of things on the figma, so I feel like I'm constantly moving around, yeah?",,[grab and release photo] there is a solution but I hate the solution. Because this is a process. If I need to do it I will do it but if I don’t then I wont. But then it comes back to bite you later. So this [the gesture] is more problem solving for me.,"[grab and release photo] I definitely think that this feature is very useful. I mean there there are definitely times when I've you know wanted to put something in my PowerPoint. I'm like I wish I can grab it like don't have to save it, you know, and I could just grab it from one like from a Bing search and just like drop it into like a PowerPoint. But yeah, I think I definitely think that it would be a helpful useful feature.",,,
Value of air gestures,Immediacy /shortcut*,4,,,,,"[audio redirection] But if there was a gestural way to say. Query quickly stop a sound, I think like gestural mute. There are lots of cases where gestural mute would be really handy.","I think I think we included one where you know the ability for for us to pause or play. You know, when you're in an active this thing, so that could apply if you look at like you know from a work perspective, right? Like if we have to go to a teams meeting, you know just just able to point to the like, highlight that join join button and then you know just just join or like mute ourselves like you know some kind of.","I would use this in a team call [..] and if I need something really fast, I could see me getting used to do these gestures and want to do it when I have my camera on.

I really like this one,"[move app] I feel like that is. I feel like that's really cool. I don't know how I would use it, but it's my coolness reaction ","It's fun to be able to use gestures,",[grab and release photo] This looks like something out of ironman movies. I think this is great.,"[move app] I think that it's a very cool feature. I think it's almost like a like a composer, so like you're taking something that's like working from like one like space and like like kind of like extending it like uh, want to like another thing. I think that that's like really cool, yeah?","[audio redirection] Oh my gosh, this is brilliant. This is absolutely brilliant. I get this an absolute 7 UM, and now I kind of understand if if there's a paradigm where that kind of grab and drop is working for like files for text for sound, then it's then it's a lot more intuitive to see it also happening with with sound. That is so cool.","[extend desktop] Yeah, I mean I think it it definitely like wowed me when I looked at it. That was my initial reaction was like, oh like I think there's a.There's something about. Being able to kind of like magically manipulate technology with with your hand in the real world, like that, that sort of play between the two is really interesting. And like it's not quite, it's not really mixed reality, but you're still interacting with technology and software and hardware, and so I find that really interesting, and I think there's you know, I. ",
Value of air gestures,Magical*,,,,,"[audio redirection] Cuteness please do it because you feel like you're grabbing the sound. Uh, I I I like I I just I just almost feel like if I grab the sound I keep hearing it but you know, with the muffled kind of timber because it's in my hand and then I put it somewhere else and then they can hear well again. It's just just yeah that.","[move app] I think its really sci-fi like I can throw it onto your tablet even. [...] But yeah, if it worked, if it were kind of more like AirDrop where I've typed something, and then I fling it at your phone or other device.",,,[audio redirection] Kind of like grab whatever audio that you're listening to and then being able to kind of like. Drag that audio to like a different device and being able to kind of then also like move it between devices I think is really really unique.,,,
Value of air gestures,Novelty*,4,,,,,[move app] There hasn't been a lot of change in how one like navigates information and you know computing so I'm kind of excited by the idea that something could be different.,,[split app] I think its cool. I can see it be useful.,,[extend desktop] So cool.,"[extend desktop] Uhm, I mean you know, I think it in terms of like novelty. I think it's quite interesting, but I think you know, does it do anything sort of more than what I can do with my my mouse pad on my laptop right now? Like maybe not?",
Value of air gestures,Novelty*,,,,,,,,,,"[split app] Oh, that's so cool.","It really be able to take advantage of something like this, and I think just like, yeah, the the the quickness of it and. And yeah, like I started to think of like things that like fully rose to the top for me. I mean there is a real novelty to it in in terms of like what this could look like, but I do think like things that start to like move sound around, move it like you know things that are on your laptop. It's just like.It just feels like it's sort of like moving us forward in terms of how we're interacting with our devices right now.",
Value of air gestures,Novelty*,,,,,,,,,,[audio redirection] Now the headphone. When can we add that to the list of most compelling that was so cool.,,
Cost of air gestures,Physically demanding,3,,,,[input redirection] I don't know that the two hand gestures seems. Like too much effort initially.,"Yeah, I think it. It's it's one of those things where you know everyone always jokes about the minority report like do you really want the minority report UI and I think one would actually be exhausted doing this constantly. But there are certain things where, yeah, just a little bit of it that would be faster.",,,,,"[gesture modifier] So I feel like so for the one that's at the bottom for me is time only because like when it doesn't feel as interactive and I think it would be you you're holding your arm up like it just feels like it's a bit exhausting. Even if you get the timing right and it doesn't feel as sort of interactive distance. Again, like is like one that feels like it could make sense. But I like the idea of like the additional modality as well.",
Cost of air gestures,Discoverability,2,"[split app] Semi randomly discover my way into that, so like so how like there will have to be some mechanism for me to learn like Oh well like these are things that I can do this with ah, but assuming that I that there's some way for me to be educated on that like I think.",,,,,,,"[extend desktop] Yeah, I think that if there was like a prompt, then where you're prompted to do some type of motion like that then I think it would make a lot of sense. But but like if you're just, you know, starting to you know integrate this type of like learning for your day today. I think it would be hard to kind of like pick up and learn because you don't know if like the device is actually going to read your hand going in and out. So I think if there was a prompt beforehand then I think it would make a whole lot of sense.",,,

Cost of air gestures,Discoverability,,"Yeah, and I guess like I think the the the secret sauce that I I I I think that if you can like you know we talking bout envisioning is is like like like how do you hint that discover ability aspect of someone without being intrusive like if they like like that that's been like one of the traditional problems but there's just some way to hit the affordance being there like or when it's applicable without.",,,,,,,,,,
Cost of air gestures,Discoverability,,There needs to be some way for me to to know when that's available to me so that so that it's actually use it when it's available. I think that's the that's the biggest challenge.,,,,,,,,,,
Cost of air gestures,Learnability,8,"So if that was actually giving you the wrong gesture, like it like it it I would get clear feedback that it wasn't interpreting me correctly.",,[gesture shortcuts] So I also think might be useful when there are more than three keys involved in the shortcut [...] for people it might be easier to remember. I take a picture [mime take a picture with a camera with hand],"[split app] The gesture seems a little bit complex, but it makes sense to me. Because you have first the kind of the selection thing, then, then you, then you grab, then you move away, then you drop. It's it's like several steps. It seems complex, prone to error for me. [...] I guess you you you can get used to it, but that that's kind of the first impression, right?","There's probably a few gestures that I would just get muscle memory for very quickly, but I don't think there are that many where.[...] Looking at my computer as a muscle or looking at my phone is like oh looking at this reminds me what the syntax is.","[move app] Like anything you, you know it comes with some kind of training, but to be because every individual is different. I mean you know if if there is an ability to configure your own gestures like preset preset gestures, right? Like for me you know this is what I associate with demarcating the  screen that I want to move, I think giving that flexibility to the user to define their own gestures and link them to you know the outcome is is a super helpful feature, right? Like people can then customize it because there are left handed people, right handed people and different people view. You know, we all use gestures differently. One thing could mean something different for you for me, so I think it being being able to.",,"So I think that the hand gesture definitely makes a lot of sense for like this type of like what you're what you're trying to do with splitting like the like. I guess like the panels I. I think it like makes sense, so I wouldn't change it. I definitely do think that there will be a learning curve and learning the different gestures because I, I think maybe you wanna keep like the gestures to be like. You know, either very simple or very.","[split app] I'll, I'll give it a 6, but only because it's great. I completely understand I I do feel like it's it's intuitive that folding your fingers is like selecting a subset of the window that's been selected. The only reason I'm giving you to six and and not a seven is because that is going to. That is, it does have a learning curve. I'm going to have to like remember it and then do it a few times before it.","[extend desktop] And I'm sure there's a learning curve and also just sort of like a habit curb. That would be happening, but I think that could be quite interesting.",
Cost of air gestures,Learnability,,,,,,,"[gesture shortcuts] Not all gestures can be replicated the way we are as a human right. Like you know how for for something you just have to have that have those rules established, right? Clapping here means we just you know, this means that for this this kind of feature that we are providing it just means that you can select the app view so that that part is OK.",,,"[gesture sequence] I'm a very visual person. I have dyslexia, so it's so much easier for me to think about. Using those gestures to kind of do things rather than pointing and clicking a button and kind of reading and doing things like that, like reading the title of things, it's it makes the digital space a little bit more spatial and I really like that.","[grab and release photo] Yeah, I mean I think it it feels much more, UM, purposeful. I think right like 'cause you're like this isn't necessarily something I would do with talking with my hands. So it doesn't like 'cause I. Another gesture that I could maybe see work for this would be a drag and drop, so like you'd like, you know, cook it and do like that. But that that could potentially feel more like an everyday thing. I think like grabbing it and putting it down feels very natural to me. It's.",
Cost of air gestures,Learnability,,,,,,,"[gesture shortcuts] Yeah, this is more learnable [than keyboard shortcuts] because it just you are, you know, brain's coordinating with your movements and it's it's it's much more. You know, like you feel more in control than having to rely on a device, but you're just like controlling your hands and your gestures by yourself. You know, it's it's I feel yeah.",,,"[gesture modifer] Yeah, the other ones, like the distance is a new set of symbols. I'd have to use the sort of the gesture with the the one before would have to be like new symbols that I would use. That I would learn.","[move app] So uhm that if there is I my, my hunch is that. I mean, I'm sure there's data behind this, but my hunch is that it would be easier to pick up [mid-air gesture rather than  other inputs]. Come in if you're you're doing it for the first or second time versus versus a different input like language.",
Cost of air gestures,Learnability,,,,,,,"Uhm, the biggest compelling thing for me as a user for this would be if I were to. That would make it more intuitve, right? Like if I were to able to define my own gestures, because we all interpret things differently, right? So you know using our gestures, so I think that just.",,,"Yeah, so so in my mind it's just the. The whole point is to cut down on cognitive load to cut down on time to cut down on effort. Uhm, so that I can actually use my brain. To you know, think about the important stuff. [...] That's why I'm like why would there be a learning curve? A learning curve wouldn't make sense. Because it wouldn't if if there is a. If there is a learning curve, then it wouldn't necessarily be worth my time to just shift from a click and point paradigm to a gesture paradigm.","And then I think, just like the for me, like the learning curve is the concern as well like it's with any of this like new new modalities like you know you, you can feel really dumb really quickly and and yeah, and so that's sort of for me. I would. I would want to feel more empowered if I was going to use something like this versus like using it, making something completely break, you know? Or do you use? You know, I don't know.",
Cost of air gestures,Accidental activation,4,"[gesture shortcuts] The thing that so so the thing that project the thing that jumped into my mind first was accidental activation. Uh, the thing they probably wouldn't want to happen is because I, like I was busy typing. I was just doing something that somehow would interpret that as an app switch.
